# Budget Tracker Starter Code

## Description
Budget tracker is an in-browser application that has been updated to be a PWA. It works offline and updates its database when the internet connection has been restored. As a mobile first app, budget tracker has a web manifest for mobile installation.

## Installation

After downloading the files, run the commands:

    npm install
    npm start

This will start the server. The application is now ready for use.

## Usage
When the server is running, enter the name, amount, and type of your transaction. for example:

name: paycheck
amount: 1038.72
type: add funds

Transactions can be made while offline, but an internet connection is required in order to update the data base.
